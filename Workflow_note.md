# Simple Roadmap for ML Application

This is a step-by-step guide to creating a basic Python-based ML application that involves loading configurations, training a model, saving it, and managing files.

# 1. Project Setup and Configuration 

Create a project directory structure:

/ml_project /data /models /logs config.yaml main.py

vbnet
Copiar

### Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
data_path: "data/train.csv"
model_output_path: "models"
logs_path: "logs"

2. Load Configuration and Set Up Directories
Use read_yaml() to load the configuration settings from config.yaml and create directories.

3. Data Preprocessing
Load and preprocess your data (clean, extract features, etc.).

4. Train Your Machine Learning Model
Train your ML model (e.g., using scikit-learn, TensorFlow).

5. Save the Trained Model
After training, save the model using save_bin() to avoid retraining.

6. Save Evaluation Metrics
Store model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss) in a JSON file using save_json().

7. Use the Model for Inference
Load the saved model using load_bin() and use it for making predictions.

8. Monitor File Sizes and Disk Usage
Use get_size() to track file sizes (especially for large models).

9. End-to-End Example
Here's the full flow in code:

python
Copiar
# Step 1: Load configuration settings from YAML file
config = read_yaml("config.yaml")

# Step 2: Create directories for saving models and logs
create_directories([config.model_output_path, config.logs_path])

# Step 3: Data preprocessing (load, clean, feature engineering)
data = preprocess_data(config.data_path)

# Step 4: Train a machine learning model (e.g., RandomForest)
trained_model = train_model(data)

# Step 5: Save the trained model
save_bin(trained_model, config.model_output_path + "/model.pkl")

# Step 6: Save evaluation metrics (accuracy, loss)
metrics = {"accuracy": 0.95, "loss": 0.1}
save_json(config.logs_path + "/metrics.json", metrics)

# Step 7: Load the trained model for inference
model = load_bin(config.model_output_path + "/model.pkl")

# Step 8: Get the size of the saved model file
model_size = get_size(config.model_output_path + "/model.pkl")
logger.info(f"Saved model size: {model_size}")

# Step 9: Make predictions with the model
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
