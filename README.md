# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project-with-ML-Flow

## .github\workflow folder is used for cicd deployments and the gitkeep is the document used for commit the folder.
## config.yaml is the file in which saves all the configuration of the project.

    Use YAML when:

    You need a human-readable format for configurations or structured data.
    You are working with applications that require complex configurations, such as Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, etc.
    You prefer a flexible format but are willing to deal with indentation as a strict rule.


## UTILS.PY
A utils.py file generally contains functions that are used throughout your project, such as data processing, file manipulation, validations, and more.

## the yaml files should not be empty
